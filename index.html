     <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>   


     <p>My name is Raven Evans, I prefer to be called "RJ" by people who are not close friends and family. I am 25 years old and have lived in Columbus, Ohio my entire life. I don't have much higher eduction outside of receivig a nurse aide certificate but I always aspire to do my best no matter what career, subject or hobby I pursue. I'm always interested in how things work. Trying to figure out how a machine functions is what piqued my interest in web development. I'm happy to be pursuing that interest now and hope to continue building my skills once I have graduated from the coding program I am currently enrolled in.</p>
