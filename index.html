        <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>

        <p>
          My name is Raven Evans, I prefer to be called "RJ" by people who are
          not close friends and family. I am 25 years old and have lived in
          Columbus, Ohio my entire life. I don't have much higher eduction
          outside of receivig a nurse aide certificate but I always aspire to do
          my best no matter what career, subject or hobby I pursue. I'm always
          interested in how things work. Trying to figure out how a machine
          functions is what piqued my interest in web development. I'm happy to
          be pursuing that interest now and hope to continue building my skills
          once I have graduated from the coding program I am currently enrolled
          in.
